# rag-cookbook-langchain

This is a collection of notebooks that I used to learn about RAG with LangChain.

There are separate notebooks for each technique.

## Techniques

1. [Chunking](./techniques/chunking/README.md)
   Chunking is the process of splitting the document into smaller chunks so that it can be processed by the LLM. There are different techniques to chunk the document like [length-based](./techniques/chunking/length-based-chunking.ipynb), [text-based](./techniques/chunking/text-based-chunking.ipynb), [semantic-based](./techniques/chunking/semantic-based-chunking.ipynb), and [document-based](./techniques/chunking/document-based-chunking.ipynb).
