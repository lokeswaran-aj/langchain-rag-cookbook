# Document Indexing

Document indexing is a crucial technique in information retrieval that organizes documents for efficient search and retrieval.


## Why it is useful?

- Enables fast and efficient document retrieval
- Reduces search time complexity
- Allows for complex queries and filtering
- Supports scalable information retrieval systems


## Common Indexing Techniques

### Inverted Index
- Maps terms to documents containing them
- Stores frequency and position information
- Optimized for full-text search


### Vector Space Model
- Represents documents as vectors
- Enables similarity comparisons
- Used with embedding-based search


### Document-Term Matrix
- Sparse matrix representation
- Rows are documents, columns are terms
- Foundation for many IR algorithms
